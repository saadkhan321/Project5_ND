are two first we would like to invit a senior leader from enron to be a key speaker at the johnson school leadership week in march 2001 as describ in the attach materi leadership week is made up of three confer focus on academ faculti leadingedg corpor and student we veri much would like enron to present what we call a live case studi at the corpor confer on underlinemarch 28 2001underlin you of
